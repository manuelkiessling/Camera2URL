### Camera2URL – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** December 2, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Camera2URL** (“the App”) handles your information on Apple’s App Store and iOS devices.  
**In short: Camera2URL does not collect, store, use, share, or sell any personal or non-personal data.**

---

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Camera2URL is designed to operate **without collecting any data** from you or your device.

- **No personal data**  
  We do not collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, address, or any other information that identifies you personally.

- **No usage data or analytics**  
  We do not collect information about how you use the App (for example, screens visited, actions taken, or session duration).

- **No device or technical data**  
  We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, operating system details, or any other technical or diagnostic data.

- **No location data**  
  We do not collect, store, or use your location (precise or approximate).

---

### 2. Camera and Photos

Camera2URL uses the device camera solely for the core functionality of the App.

- Any images or video captured using the App remain **on your device** or are transmitted **only as you explicitly direct** (for example, to a URL or service you configure).  
- The App **does not**:
  - Upload captured media to our servers (we operate no backend for this App).
  - Collect or store copies of your captured media.
  - Analyze, track, or profile the content of your media.

Any transmission of data that you configure (for example, sending images to your own server or service) is **under your control** and is **not collected or controlled by us**.

---

### 3. Third-Party Services and SDKs

- The App **does not integrate** any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or social media SDKs.  
- We do not share any data with third parties because **no data is collected** in the first place.

System-provided Apple frameworks may be used solely to provide the App’s basic functionality, and not for data collection or tracking by us.

---

### 4. Children’s Privacy

Because Camera2URL does not collect any data from any users, it does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction).

If you believe a child has provided data to us through some external means, please contact us using the information in the **Contact Us** section below. However, as noted above, the App itself does not collect data.

---

### 5. Data Retention

Since Camera2URL does not collect any data, **we do not retain any user data**.

Any data you handle using the App (for example, images you capture and send to your own systems) are managed solely by you and/or the third-party services you choose to use, and are outside of our control.

---

### 6. Your Rights

Because we do not collect or store any data:

- We do not have any data to access, correct, delete, or transfer.  
- Requests to exercise data protection rights (such as access, deletion, or portability) will typically result in a confirmation that **we hold no data about you**.

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy in relation to the App, you can still contact us as described below.

---

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in the App, legal requirements, or our practices.

- If we make material changes, we will update the **“Effective date”** at the top of this Policy.  
- Any changes will take effect when the updated Policy is made available via the App Store listing and/or within the App.

We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically.
