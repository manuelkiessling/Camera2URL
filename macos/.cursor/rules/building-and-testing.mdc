# Building and Testing Verification

After making code changes to this Xcode project, always verify your work by building and running tests.

## Build Verification

After modifying Swift files, run from the project root:

```bash
make build
```

The build must succeed (`BUILD SUCCEEDED`) before considering the task complete.

## Unit Test Verification

After making functional changes, run unit tests:

```bash
make test
```

Unit tests should pass. Note: Some test flakiness may occur due to shared mock state - if a single test fails intermittently, re-run to confirm.

## UI Test Verification

After making UI changes, run UI tests:

```bash
make ui-test
```

UI tests launch the app through the automation runner. They require an interactive macOS session and camera permission.

## When to Verify

- **Always run `make build`** after modifying any `.swift` file
- **Run `make test`** after modifying Services, Models, Stores, or ViewModels
- **Run `make ui-test`** after modifying Views, ContentView, or any UI-related code
- **Clean build** (`xcodebuild clean build`) if encountering unexpected errors after file moves or renames
